# Autonomous Recorder
This code was written for team 5588R, but it can be easily modified to work with your team's robot.

## Notes
- Code isn't fully finished yet, atm it only records drivetrain movements
- Make sure you have a SD Card inserted into the brain so the robot can record controller inputs
