# Autonomous Recorder
This code was written for team 5588R, but it can be easily modified to work with your team's robot.

## Notes
- Code isn't fully finished yet, atm it only records drivetrain movements
- The current code has some issues with playback not being accurate. This is being worked on.
- Make sure you have a SD Card inserted into the brain so the robot can record controller inputs
- Make sure you have two versions; `aa3_RECORDER` and `aa3_RUNNER` downloaded to your robot. For the recorder program, set `bool recording = true` and the opposite for the runner program. Then, just rename the files accordingly and save to seperate slots.
